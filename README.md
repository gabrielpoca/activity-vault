# Activity Vault

> **Warning**
> This is work in progress.

Activity Vault is a regular Account Abstraction contract that turns into a
multisig after a certain period of inactivity. It can be used to delegate
operations on your account to a group of people while you are out or to allow
your family members to manage your assets when you pass away. There are likely
other uses for this.

The contract can be deployed on zksync.
